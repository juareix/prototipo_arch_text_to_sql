"""
Client script module for mebedding with factory pattern implementation.

This module provides a client-side script for mebedding operations and implements
a factory pattern to dynamically switch between different embedding models based
on environment variables. This allows for flexible model configuration without
modifying the core application code.

Key features:
- Factory pattern for model abstraction and switching
- Environment-based model selection
- Client implementation for mebedding services
